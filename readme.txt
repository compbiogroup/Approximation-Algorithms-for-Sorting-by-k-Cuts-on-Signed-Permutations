These are the data sets generators and algorithms used in the paper "Approximation Algorithms for Sorting by k-Cuts on Signed Permutations"

Table 2 has the results from A1.py (Algorithm 1 from paper) using as input the data sets generated by "generate-4.sh"

Tables 3-6 have the results from  BS.py (described in Section 3.2 of the paper) and CG.py (Algorithm 2 from the paper) using as input the data sets generated by "generate-k.sh"
